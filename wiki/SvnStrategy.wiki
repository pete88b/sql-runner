#summary Overview of how this project uses subversion.

This isn't meant to be restrictive, it's just a guide that can be updated as the project evolves.
But as this is a little project, it makes sense to keep svn use simple.

===trunk===
Development happens here.

===branches===
Could be used to work on changes that would be disruptive to development in trunk - but are intended to be merged back into trunk.

===tags===
Used to keep a copy of trunk for all releases.
  e.g. svn/tags/RELEASE-1.0.0/sql-runner is a copy of the 1st release of sql-runner - and shouldn't be updated.
