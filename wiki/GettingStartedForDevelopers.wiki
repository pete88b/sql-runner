#summary Here's what you need to know if you want to build from source.

= Introduction =

Because the test code needs the Oracle JDBC drivers to compile, you'll need them in your local maven repository;
  # Download Oracle JDBC drivers for Java 5
  # mvn install:install-file -D"file=./ojdbc5-11.2.0.4.jar" -D"groupId=oracle" -D"artifactId=oracle-jdbc5" -D"version=11.2.0.4" -D"packaging=jar"

If you want to build without integration testing, just do a maven install;
{{{
mvn.bat -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install
}}}

If you want to run integration tests, you'll need to set-up a DB account to connect to and get the database drivers in your local maven repository.
The maven command to build and run integration tests is;
{{{
mvn.bat -Dsurefire.exclude=ExclUdeNOTHING -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install
}}}

== Database set-up Details ==

To run integration tests you need access to an Oracle database and a Derby/Java DB. 

Here's how I set things up with both databases running on my machine;

To create the Oracle DB account (sqlrunner_test). e.g. Run the following commands via SQL*Plus; 
  * CREATE USER sqlrunner_test DEFAULT TABLESPACE users IDENTIFIED BY weak_pw;
  * GRANT DBA TO sqlrunner_test;

The default DB connection details are (see src/test/resources/oracle/test-context-oracle.xml); 
  # url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/xe
  # username=sqlrunner_test
  # password=weak_pw

To create the Derby database (sqlrunner_test); 
  * Database Name: sqlrunner_test
  * User Name: sqlrunner_test
  * Password: weak_pw

The default DB connection details are (see src/test/resources/derby/test-context-derby.xml); 
  # url=jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sqlrunner_test
  # username=sqlrunner_test
  # password=weak_pw
