#summary Here's what you need to know if you want to build from source.

= Introduction =

If you want to build without integration testing, just do a maven install;
{{{
mvn.bat -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install
}}}

If you want to run integration tests, you'll need to set-up a DB account to connect to and get the database drivers in your local maven repository.
The maven command to build and run integration tests is;
{{{
mvn.bat -Dsurefire.exclude=ExclUdeNOTHING -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install
}}}

== Database set-up Details ==

To run integration tests you need access to a database. Here's how I set things up with an Oracle database running on my machine;
  # Download Oracle JDBC drivers for Java 5
  # To create the DB account (sqlrunner_test). e.g. Run the following commands via SQL*Plus; 
    * CREATE USER sqlrunner_test DEFAULT TABLESPACE users IDENTIFIED BY weak_pw;
    * GRANT DBA TO sqlrunner_test;

The default DB connection details are (see src/test/resources/test-context.xml); 
  # url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/xe
  # user=sqlrunner_test
  # password=weak_pw
